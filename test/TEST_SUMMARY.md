# Statistical Validation Framework for Margins.jl: A Comprehensive Testing Methodology

## Abstract

This document delineates the statistical validation framework employed in the Margins.jl package test suite. The testing methodology implements a rigorous, multi-tiered approach to statistical correctness verification, ensuring that all computational procedures adhere to established econometric standards. The framework operates under a strict zero-tolerance policy for statistical invalidity, prioritizing mathematical correctness over computational convenience.

## 1. Introduction

The statistical validation framework for Margins.jl represents a systematic approach to ensuring computational correctness in marginal effects estimation. The testing architecture addresses the fundamental challenge of verifying statistical software: establishing that numerical implementations correctly reproduce theoretical econometric results while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for empirical research applications.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations of Statistical Validation

### 2.1 Mathematical Ground Truth Verification
The primary validation principle employs analytical solution comparison, whereby computational outputs are evaluated against closed-form mathematical solutions. This approach establishes absolute correctness benchmarks:
- Numerical tolerance thresholds are set at machine precision levels (`atol=1e-12`) for deterministic computations
- Linear model marginal effects must reproduce coefficient estimates with exact numerical correspondence
- Generalized linear model (GLM) transformations are validated through analytical chain rule derivations, specifically verifying that response-scale effects satisfy `∂μ/∂x = β × g'(η)` where `g'` denotes the first derivative of the inverse link function

### 2.2 Empirical Standard Error Validation Through Bootstrap Methods
The framework implements comprehensive bootstrap validation procedures to verify the statistical properties of delta-method standard error computations:
- Bootstrap resampling with 150-200 replications provides empirical standard error distributions
- Convergence criteria require agreement within 15% relative error between delta-method and bootstrap standard errors
- The validation encompasses the full spectrum of model specifications, including linear models, binary response models (logistic regression), count data models (Poisson regression), and mixed variable type specifications

### 2.3 Computational Backend Equivalence Testing
Multiple computational pathways ensure robustness through cross-validation of numerical methods:
- Automatic Differentiation (AD) and Finite Differences (FD) implementations must demonstrate numerical equivalence within specified tolerances (`rtol=1e-8` for point estimates, `rtol=1e-6` for standard errors)
- Each statistical quantity undergoes verification through independent computational algorithms
- The FD implementation achieves zero-allocation performance characteristics while preserving mathematical accuracy equivalent to AD methods

## 3. Testing Architecture: The 2×2 Conceptual Framework

### 3.1 Systematic Framework for Comprehensive Validation
The validation architecture is structured around a 2×2 conceptual framework that systematically addresses all combinations of computational approaches in marginal effects analysis:
- The first dimension distinguishes between population-level averaging (integrating across the empirical distribution) and profile-specific evaluation (computation at specified covariate values)
- The second dimension differentiates between marginal effects (partial derivatives) and adjusted predictions (conditional expectations)

This framework yields four distinct validation quadrants:
1. **Average Marginal Effects (AME)**: Population-averaged partial derivatives across the sample distribution
2. **Average Adjusted Predictions (AAP)**: Population-averaged fitted values integrating over the empirical covariate distribution
3. **Marginal Effects at Representative Values (MER)**: Partial derivatives evaluated at specified covariate profiles
4. **Adjusted Predictions at Representative Values (APR)**: Conditional expectations computed at specified covariate configurations

### 3.2 Universal Validation Methodology
The `test_2x2_framework_quadrants()` function implements a standardized validation protocol:
- **Input specification**: Statistical model object and associated dataset
- **Computational procedure**: Systematic evaluation across all four quadrants with comprehensive validity assessments
- **Output metrics**: Validation results encompassing finiteness checks, standard error positivity constraints, and computational convergence indicators
- **Generalizability**: The protocol applies uniformly across diverse model specifications including linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, and mixed-effects models

## 4. Hierarchical Validation Framework

### 4.1 Tier 1: Analytical Coefficient Correspondence
The foundational validation tier establishes exact correspondence between computed marginal effects and theoretical values:
- For linear specifications, the equality `∂y/∂x = β₁` is verified to machine precision tolerance (`atol=1e-12`)
- Multiple regression coefficients undergo independent validation to ensure correct partial derivative computation
- Standard error computations for linear models must demonstrate exact correspondence with GLM-derived coefficient standard errors
- This tier establishes the computational accuracy baseline with deterministic verification

### 4.2 Tiers 1A & 1B: Standard Error Theoretical Validation
These tiers address the theoretical properties of variance estimation:
- Linear model specifications require exact correspondence between delta-method standard errors and analytical derivations from the model's variance-covariance matrix
- GLM specifications undergo chain rule validation, verifying that response-scale standard errors satisfy `SE[∂μ/∂x] = |g'(η)| × SE(β)` where `g'(η)` represents the derivative of the inverse link function
- The framework validates preservation of coefficient standard errors under link-scale transformations and appropriate chain rule application for response-scale transformations

### 4.3 Tier 2: Nonlinear Function Transformation Validation
This tier addresses computational challenges in nonlinear specifications:
- Logarithmic transformations require validation of the analytical derivative `∂/∂x[β log(x)] = β/x` with appropriate numerical safeguards for domain restrictions
- Polynomial specifications undergo derivative validation for higher-order terms and interaction effects
- The framework ensures robust handling of function domain constraints while maintaining numerical stability

### 4.4 Tier 3: Generalized Linear Model Chain Rule Implementation
Comprehensive validation of GLM-specific transformations:
- Binary response models (logistic regression) validate the chain rule `∂μ/∂x = β × μ(1-μ)` through analytical probability derivative calculations
