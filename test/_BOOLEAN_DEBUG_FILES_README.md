# Boolean Allocation Debug Files (Historical)

**Status**: RESOLVED - These files are historical diagnostic scripts from debugging boolean categorical allocation issues.

## Background

During development (October 2025), boolean categorical variables showed allocation overhead compared to string categoricals. These files were created to isolate and diagnose the issue.

## Root Cause (RESOLVED)

The issue was **NOT** in FormulaCompiler.jl. The allocation source was in Margins.jl's `generate_contrast_pairs` function, which used `collect(view(...))` pattern that allocated for boolean types.

**Fix**: Pre-allocate arrays at function scope instead of using `collect(view(...))`. Both boolean and string categoricals now achieve zero allocations.

## Files in this collection

- `test_boolean_allocation_profile.jl` - Initial profiling to identify allocation source
- `test_boolean_alloc_isolation.jl` - Isolated testing of contrast pair generation  
- `test_boolean_contrast_pair_types.jl` - Type stability analysis
- `test_isolate_batch_kernel_only.jl` - Batch kernel isolation
- `test_verify_boolean_fix.jl` - Verification that fix achieves zero allocations
- `test_bool_cf_vector_type.jl` - Counterfactual vector type checking
- `profile_bool_allocations.jl` - Quick profiling script

## Current Status

âœ… **RESOLVED**: Both boolean and string categoricals achieve zero allocations in production code.

**Evidence**:
- `test_per_row_allocations.jl`: Binary variable contrasts = 0 allocations
- `test_allocation_scaling.jl`: All categorical types = 0 allocations  
- `test_zero_allocations.jl`: Boolean variables in formulas = <100 allocations (DataFrame overhead only)

## Should these files be deleted?

**Recommendation**: Keep for historical reference, but they are no longer needed for active testing.

**Alternative**: Archive to `test/archive/boolean_debug/` to keep test directory clean.
