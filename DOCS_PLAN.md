# DOCS_PLAN.md - Documentation Status

**STATUS: Documentation migration completed September 2025**

## Current Documentation State

### Core Documentation Files Status:
- **`docs/src/index.md`** ✅ Updated - Quick Start uses current `means_grid()` API
- **`docs/src/profile_margins.md`** ✅ Updated - Reference grid approach documented
- **`docs/src/api.md`** ✅ Updated - Current function signatures
- **`docs/src/reference_grids.md`** ✅ Updated - Builder functions documented

### Known Issues:
- **Build System**: Printf dependency prevents doc building (content is correct)
- **Minor Examples**: Some specialized files may need updates

### Next Actions:
- Academic Writing Style Compliance
- Monitor for API changes requiring doc updates
- Resolve build environment issues when needed
- Update examples as package evolves

## Academic Writing Style Compliance

### Current Status: Academic Writing Style Compliance - COMPLETE ✅
All core documentation files have been successfully converted from user-friendly manual style to formal academic tone as specified in CLAUDE.md. The documentation now meets econometric research community standards.

### Style Conversion Checklist

#### Core Documentation Files
- [x] **`docs/src/index.md`** - Convert bullet points to flowing paragraphs, adopt formal academic tone
- [x] **`docs/src/mathematical_foundation.md`** - Enhance theoretical exposition, use scholarly prose
- [x] **`docs/src/api.md`** - Rewrite function descriptions in formal academic language
- [x] **`docs/src/profile_margins.md`** - Convert user manual style to methodological exposition
- [x] **`docs/src/reference_grids.md`** - Adopt formal statistical terminology throughout

#### Style Requirements Implementation
- [x] Replace bullet-point conceptual explanations with complete paragraph prose
- [x] Convert casual tone to formal academic language suitable for computational statistics journals
- [x] Implement appropriate passive voice construction in methodological sections
- [x] Remove marketing elements (emojis, bold emphasis, casual phrases)
- [x] Add formal mathematical notation and statistical terminology
- [x] Structure sections following academic paper conventions
- [x] Emphasize methodological rigor and theoretical foundations
- [x] Write exposition as if preparing technical methodology paper for peer review

#### Specific Transformations Needed
- [x] Convert "This function averages effects..." → "Effects are averaged across the observed sample distribution..."
- [x] Replace "clean framework that attempts to minimize confusion" → formal methodological exposition
- [x] Transform bullet-point use cases into flowing methodological discussion
- [x] Add formal statistical definitions and theoretical justification
- [x] Include proper citation-ready mathematical formulation
- [x] Implement scholarly paragraph structure for conceptual explanations
