# Margins.jl Documentation

This Julia package provides a suite of functions to compute marginal effects and related contrasts for predictors in GLM/GLMM models:
1. **Adjusted predictions at the mean** (APM) and **marginal effects at the mean** (MEM)
2. **Average Marginal Effects** (AMEs) and **marginal effects at representative values** (MERS)

As it stands, marginal effect calculations, and AME calculations in particular, are a huge gap in statistical modeling in Julia that really limits the ways researchers can take advantage of packages like [MixedModels.jl](https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl).[^1]

[^1]: Furthermore, other packages that seek to convert models estimated in Julia into R objects (which can then be used with the mature modeling ecosystem) ultimately feed into another two-language problem (though this strategy may be the best current option in many situations).

Note that this package is similar in spirit to [Effects.jl](https://github.com/beacon-biosignals/Effects.jl), and borrows directly from it for the APM calculations. Ultimately, the design of this package refers heavily to Stata's ["margins"](https://www.stata.com/manuals/cmmargins.pdf) commands.
