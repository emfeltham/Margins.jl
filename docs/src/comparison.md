## Stata Migration Guide

For researchers familiar with Stata's `margins` command, Margins.jl provides equivalent functionality with a clean conceptual mapping. The key difference is that Margins.jl separates the choice of *where* to evaluate (population vs profile) from *what* to compute (effects vs predictions).

### Basic Command Translation

| Stata Command | Margins.jl Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| `margins, dydx(*)` | `population_margins(model, data; type=:effects)` | Average marginal effects (AME) |
| `margins, at(means) dydx(*)` | `profile_margins(model, data, means_grid(data); type=:effects)` | Marginal effects at means (MEM) |
| `margins` | `population_margins(model, data; type=:predictions)` | Average adjusted predictions |
| `margins, at(means)` | `profile_margins(model, data, means_grid(data); type=:predictions)` | Adjusted predictions at means |

### Advanced Command Translation

| Stata Command | Margins.jl Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| `margins, at(x=0 x=1 x=2)` | `profile_margins(model, data, cartesian_grid(x=[0,1,2]); type=:predictions)` | Multiple evaluation points |
| `margins, at(x=0 z=1) at(x=1 z=2)` | `profile_margins(model, data, DataFrame(x=[0,1], z=[1,2]); type=:predictions)` | Custom scenarios |
| `margins, over(group)` | `population_margins(model, data; groups=:group)` | Subgroup analysis |
| `margins, dydx(x) at(z=(0 1))` | `profile_margins(model, data, cartesian_grid(z=[0,1]); type=:effects, vars=[:x])` | Specific variables |

### Elasticity Commands

| Stata Command | Margins.jl Equivalent | Notes |
|---------------|----------------------|-------|
| `margins, eyex(*)` | `population_margins(model, data; type=:effects, measure=:elasticity)` | Elasticities |
| `margins, eydx(*)` | `population_margins(model, data; type=:effects, measure=:semielasticity_eydx)` | Y semi-elasticity |
| `margins, dyex(*)` | `population_margins(model, data; type=:effects, measure=:semielasticity_dyex)` | X semi-elasticity |

### Conceptual Differences

**Stata approach**: Single `margins` command with many options
- Combines evaluation point and computation type in complex syntax
- Options like `at()`, `dydx()`, `over()` modify behavior

**Margins.jl approach**: Separate functions for different purposes
- `population_margins()` for sample-wide averages (AME/AAP)
- `profile_margins()` for scenario-specific analysis (MEM/APM)
- Clean parameter separation: `type` (effects/predictions), `measure` (elasticity type), reference grids for scenarios

### Migration Example

Here's a complete example showing equivalent analysis:

**Stata:**
```stata
* Fit logistic model
logit employed education age c.age#c.age

* Average marginal effects
margins, dydx(*)

* Effects at means
margins, at(means) dydx(*)

* Effects at specific ages
margins, at(age=(25 35 45 55)) dydx(education)
```

**Margins.jl:**
```julia
using Margins, GLM, DataFrames

# Fit logistic model  
model = glm(@formula(employed ~ education + age + age^2), data, Binomial(), LogitLink())

# Average marginal effects
ame = population_margins(model, data; type=:effects)
DataFrame(ame)

# Effects at means
mem = profile_margins(model, data, means_grid(data); type=:effects) 
DataFrame(mem)

# Effects at specific ages
age_effects = profile_margins(model, data, 
    cartesian_grid(age=[25, 35, 45, 55]); 
    vars=[:education], 
    type=:effects
)
DataFrame(age_effects)
```

### Migration Considerations

**Performance characteristics**: Different computational approaches may affect performance, particularly for:
- Large datasets (>10k observations)
- Complex profile specifications
- Repeated analysis workflows

**Conceptual differences**: The population vs profile distinction provides an alternative way to think about marginal analysis:
- `population_margins()` characterizes sample-wide patterns
- `profile_margins()` examines specific scenarios

**Ecosystem integration**: Julia's statistical ecosystem provides:
- Mixed models via MixedModels.jl
- Robust standard errors via CovarianceMatrices.jl
- Custom model types via StatsAPI

## Design Philosophy

Margins.jl was designed with several key principles:

1. **Performance first**: Built on FormulaCompiler.jl for zero-allocation computation paths
2. **Conceptual clarity**: Population vs Profile framework instead of statistical acronyms
3. **Ecosystem integration**: Works seamlessly with Julia's statistical ecosystem via StatsAPI
4. **Mathematical rigor**: Proper gradient computation and delta-method standard errors throughout

## Performance Characteristics

### AME Performance Background

Average marginal effects (AME) have traditionally been slow because most implementations evaluate the fitted model once per observation to compute numerical derivatives. This creates O(n) complexity with substantial per-evaluation overhead. For large datasets, this computational cost often led researchers to use marginal effects at means (MEM) as a faster alternative.

### Computational Approach

**Margins.jl**: Uses compiled formula evaluation with dual FD/AD backends. In indicative benchmark results, achieves approximately 50ns per marginal effect with zero allocations after warmup via FormulaCompiler.jl. Computes derivatives directly from compiled formulas rather than repeated model prediction calls.

**Effects.jl**: Uses automatic differentiation (ForwardDiff.jl) for gradient computation with standard Julia model prediction. Clean implementation but allocates ~400-500 bytes per gradient computation.

**R margins**: Interpretation-based approach requiring repeated `predict()` calls per observation. Generally slower for large datasets due to evaluation overhead (Leeper, 2017).

**Stata margins**: Compiled implementation with good performance, but still uses interpretation-based approach. Closed-source implementation limits optimization possibilities.

**Python statsmodels**: Mixed approach with some optimizations, but limited by Python overhead for large-scale AME computation.

### Performance Differences

The key difference is computational approach:

- **Traditional approach**: n model evaluations × interpretation overhead  
- **Margins.jl approach**: Compiled formula evaluation (~7ns) + finite difference (~40ns) + delta-method SE (~10ns) = ~57ns per observation with zero allocations

These architectural differences may become more noticeable with larger datasets.

### Benchmarking Context

While formal cross-language benchmarks are complex due to different implementations and ecosystems, indicative performance characteristics suggest architectural differences:

- **Small problems (n < 1,000)**: Most packages perform adequately, overhead differences typically negligible
- **Medium problems (n ~ 10,000)**: Different architectural approaches may show varying performance characteristics
- **Large problems (n > 100,000)**: Architectural differences become more apparent, with allocation patterns affecting scalability

Zero-allocation approaches can help AME computation scale with dataset size by avoiding additional memory allocation.

## API Design Comparison

### Conceptual Framework

**Margins.jl**: Uses Population vs Profile framework with orthogonal parameters:
```julia
population_margins(model, data; type=:effects, measure=:elasticity)
profile_margins(model, data, means_grid(data); type=:effects)
```

**Effects.jl**: Function-based approach with keyword arguments:
```julia
effects(model; x1=0.5, x2=[0, 1])  # At specific values
effects(model, data)               # Average marginal effects
```

**R margins**: Function-based approach with extensive options:
```r
margins(model, data, at = list(x = c(-1, 0, 1)))
```

**Stata margins**: Command-based with extensive syntax:
```stata
margins, at(x=(-1 0 1)) dydx(x)
```

**Python statsmodels**: Method-based approach:
```python
marginal_effects = model.get_margeff(at='mean')
```

### Strengths and Tradeoffs

**Margins.jl characteristics:**
- Conceptual separation of population vs profile approaches
- Type-stable, composable design
- Interface consistent across model types
- Elasticity support across multiple measures
- Focus on zero-allocation performance

**Effects.jl characteristics:**
- Simple, focused API
- Automatic differentiation integration

- Less performance optimization
- Fewer advanced statistical features

## Ecosystem Integration

### Language Ecosystems

**Margins.jl**: Integrates with Julia's statistical ecosystem via StatsAPI. Models that implement the standard interface work with the package, including mixed models and custom models.

**Effects.jl**: Also uses StatsAPI for integration, works well with standard Julia statistical models. More lightweight approach with fewer dependencies.

**R margins**: Good integration with R's modeling ecosystem, though sometimes requires package-specific implementations.

**Stata margins**: Excellent integration within Stata's ecosystem, but limited extensibility.

**Python statsmodels**: Part of the statsmodels ecosystem with good integration there, more limited beyond.

## Mathematical Rigor

### Gradient Computation

**Margins.jl**: Uses gradient computation with delta-method standard errors. Provides both finite differences and automatic differentiation backends.

**Other packages**: Use various approaches to derivative computation, with implementation details varying by package and language ecosystem.

### Standard Error Computation

Most packages implement delta-method standard errors, with different approaches to optimization and numerical accuracy.

## Margins.jl Approach

Margins.jl brings several distinctive features to marginal effects analysis:

**Computational approach**: Uses compiled formula evaluation with zero-allocation performance paths, which in indicative benchmarks can be beneficial for large-scale analysis and repeated computations.

**Conceptual framework**: Separates the question of *where* to evaluate (population vs profile) from *what* to compute (effects vs predictions), providing conceptual clarity in analysis design.

**Elasticity support**: Provides comprehensive elasticity computation including standard elasticities, x-semi-elasticities, and y-semi-elasticities across both population and profile approaches.

**Ecosystem integration**: Works within Julia's statistical ecosystem, supporting mixed models, robust standard errors, and custom model types through common interfaces.

## Future Development

Margins.jl development benefits from Julia's evolving ecosystem. Relevant factors for future development include:

1. **Language characteristics**: Julia's design enables certain types of optimizations
2. **Ecosystem integration**: Statistical methods can integrate via common interfaces
3. **Development activity**: Both Margins.jl and FormulaCompiler.jl continue active development

## Ecosystem Maturity Considerations

An important factor in package selection is ecosystem maturity and validation in applied settings:

**Established packages** (Stata margins, R margins): These have extensive validation through years of use in econometric research and applied statistics. Their implementations have been tested across diverse research contexts and publication processes.

**Julia ecosystem**: While Julia's statistical ecosystem is rapidly maturing, it represents a more experimental environment. Packages like Margins.jl and Effects.jl are newer and have smaller user bases compared to established tools in Stata and R.

**Practical implications**:
- For high-stakes research requiring maximum confidence in implementation, established packages may be preferable
- For research prioritizing computational performance or new methodological approaches, newer Julia packages may offer advantages
- Cross-validation of results across packages can provide additional confidence when using newer implementations

## Conclusion

Margins.jl provides an alternative approach with different performance characteristics and API design. Being newer than established packages, it represents a different set of tradeoffs in the marginal effects landscape.

Package selection depends on specific requirements, use cases, and tolerance for ecosystem maturity differences. Margins.jl offers a different approach to marginal effects computation that may be beneficial in certain contexts, while established packages provide proven reliability in applied research settings.
